This vision became reality in 2022 with our debut in\n    <span>Indonesia</span>, headlined by the launch of the Beast Max shoe series and the\n    Flutter racket line. <br />\n    <br />\n    Since then, HNDRD has evolved into a <span>multi-sport powerhouse</span>.<br />\n    <br />\n    We expanded rapidly across Asia, the Middle East, and into the USA, while\n    simultaneously diversifying our portfolio to include <span>\n      Pickleball, Padel,\n      Football, and Running\n    </span>. <br />\n    <br />\n    Our growth is defined by the athletes who trust us. What started with\n    signing Danish star <span>Line Kjaersfeldt</span> in 2023 has grown into a global roster\n    of over 70 athletes. From badminton icons like <span>Srikanth Kidambi</span> and <span>\n      Rasmus\n      Gemke\n    </span> to pickleball pros <span> Armaan Bhatia</span> and <span>Harsh Mehta</span>, we are dedicated to\n    empowering every player to give their 100%.\n  </p>\n</section>",
